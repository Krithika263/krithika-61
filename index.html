        <p>Long before a huge scramble of paper-folded cranes invaded our math classes at school, origami already had unsuspected uses and functions in Japan, where it was invented.

From its use by medieval samurai as a concentration technique before battle to its inspiring characteristics for future spaceships that will take us to other galaxies, this paper-folding art has evolved to become part of human culture.

<br><br>From the typical cranes to bats and elaborate dragons, there’s no shape that can’t be recreated in origami. A student from Ohio, in the United States, holds the world record for the most origami birds: 30,000 of them, all identical.

In Japan, the biggest origami of all time is also a bird, but it's 86 meters tall and was made by 800 people. Warriors, medieval caravels, or entire cities: the only universal rule for these sophisticated folds is to not use either scissors or glue.
